## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a **hardware‚Äìsoftware co-design** that mimics the essential functions of a **real-world intravenous (IV) infusion pump**, integrating **Arduino-based sensor control** with a **Python-based graphical interface (GUI)**.

Our goal was to **simulate realistic infusion pump behaviors**, including:

* **Fluid flow control**
* **Color-based fluid detection (blood leak monitoring)**
* **Flow rate monitoring**
* **Alarm management**
* **Battery simulation**
* **Manual & automatic pump modes**

We aimed to capture both **technical accuracy** and **user safety mechanisms**, just like real infusion systems used in hospitals ‚Äî all in a **miniaturized educational prototype** suitable for microelectronics learning and medical device training.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

### üîß Arduino Layer ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Controller‚Äù

The Arduino Uno handles **sensor readings**, **pump actuation** (using Keypad Controls), and **alarm triggers**.

Key components:

* **Flowmeter (YF-S401)** ‚Üí Measures real-time fluid flow rate
* **Color Sensor (TCS230/TCS3200)** ‚Üí Detects abnormal fluid color (e.g., blood leakage)
* **2N2222 transistor circuit** ‚Üí Controls the infusion pump speed
* **Buzzer** ‚Üí Audible alarms for alerts and safety breaches

### üß† Python Layer ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Interface & Intelligence‚Äù

Using **PyQt5**, the GUI acts as a digital display unit and control dashboard:

* Shows **real-time flow rate**, **pump power**, and **status indicators**
* Visual and auditory alarms (e.g., blood leakage, occlusion, low battery)
* Manual control slider for pump power
* Auto mode switch that lets Arduino handle safety logic
* Simulated **battery drain system** for embedded realism

Communication between both layers occurs through **Serial (USB)** using `pyserial`.

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

| Function                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ü©∏ **Blood Leakage Detection** | The color sensor identifies changes in the color spectrum of the fluid. If red intensity dominates, the system labels it as **BLOOD LEAKAGE** and immediately triggers an alarm. |
| üíß **Flow Monitoring**         | The flowmeter sends pulse counts per second to measure **flow rate (mL/min)**. Low readings under normal power levels activate **occlusion warnings**.                           |
| ‚ö° **Pump Control**             | The pump operates under either **AUTO** (sensor-based) or **MANUAL** (user-defined PWM speed) mode.                                                                              |
| üîî **Alarm System**            | Multi-tier alarms for blood leakage, occlusion, communication errors, and low battery ‚Äî each with distinct sound and visual patterns.                                            |
